# golang-https-clientserver

## Overview 

The client and server used to create unikernels for a simple secure tls connection and verification (based on certstrap)

I have included a config file for both the client and server when creating the ops image (unikernel)


## Reference

Both client and server were based form the project https://github.com/youngkin/gohttps.git
